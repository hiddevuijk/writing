\section{Balance}
Global balance experiment

neurons in the cortex receive input, primarily, from other cortical neurons resulting in recurrent networks. The input comes from both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In these recurrent networks the  inhibition and excitation are approximately balanced -- refs --. This results in, for example, that the network is able to generate persistent activity without any stimulus and generates an irregular firing pattern.
