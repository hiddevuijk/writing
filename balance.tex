\section{Balance}
Neurons receive both excitatory and inhibitory input. This input is balanced in the sense that the ratio between the synaptic inhibition and exitation is constant  for a certain range of the relevant conditions\cite{haider2006neocortical, shu2003turning, okun2008instantaneous, xue2014equalizing}.
This balance has several advantages ... such as an increase in temporal resolution \cite{wehr2003balanced} and selectivity of the neuron.
The balance results in the total synaptic input  current of a neuron to be in the vicinity of the thresh hold, and exceeding the threshold at random intervals, causing an irregular firing pattern.
Using a computational model it has been show that a neural network with balanced excitation and inhibition result in a inter-spike interval(ISI) distribution the is similar to experimentally observed distributions \cite{shadlen1998variable, shadlen1994noise}.

A computational model in which the inhibitory excitatory balance naturally -- -- emerges is the neural network with spars random binary connections \cite{vreeswijk1996chaos, vreeswijk1998chaotic}.
